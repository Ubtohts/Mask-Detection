# let's start a new project with a new shayri, as i do always

i dont know after this project, i will make any new project or not..
don't ask me a reason. coz, all have their own problems...


So here i end up your curiosity... yaaa exactly you guess right...
here i end up your 2-3 year's curiosity..

But before reading this, i wish that you also read with the same vibe as i had read..
ab 2-3 sal tak ruke ho to thoda aur sahi...

open your favorite code editor with pinch color theme at early morning (exact 3-4 am) with coffee and empty room.
i think i forgot something. umm... yaaa!! it's rain... (The most important thing)

Finally, Enjoy the beautiful word....
        
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        I Believe even that i got tired a lot! The think, that you think; that not happened! but The day come,
                And that is best thing that happened to you! That's why Believe! And not give up.
                                           "Believing in Miracles".
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

it's not just a word, it's felling/experience/and so more...(it's everything)

as i know, you still ask me why you told us. when we asking you, you sew your mouth with..!?!?!?
    Coz i think it's my last project. So sorry but i want to stop here..
    
i told you this words(lines), coz whenever i stuck in the code's bug and got error, i read this.. it's not motivation...
may be it's hope that gives me a next level energy..

if you also a pro assumer like me. thn i suggest, assume that he/she(Your Favourite) saying you this word... (0 to 1)
for me it's my classmate. notify me does this work or not for you..!!

i also share a story how i get this ...
in the my first ml model project due to some envirometal issue's tensorflow didn't work in my pc.
and believe me, 24+ hour are done and still i didn't get solustion for this issue...
times are passing and now 70+ hours are done and still results are the same.. nothing work;;;; 

thn someone told me "ek bar vapas delete mar ke dekh le maybe ho jaye." and idk why,
i aceept his advice and delete everything. And right now i am not only lost the my environment/setup/dependancies but i lost my Antaryami(AI)'s 9 fully funcational file.

6 days are done and i still didn't get any solustion, so after lossing all hopes i start my phone and opened a youtube.
and start watching video on Yt. Suddenly youtube give me a randome suggestion ..(Turkey series with hindi Music )
This is the first time i watched turkey series and their actores..

now after seeing a short clip, now i am curious to see what happned and how turkish people make series!!!!!
and after googling it i found that, the YT clip is from ("Kiralik ask") which is turkish drama.

and after watching 73 episodes of 120mins i learn so many things. i cant describe but lot's.

i know its serial or drama but "ku6 chize ko pasand nahi karna padta vo apne aap ho jata he"
yaa, i am the one "jo ghar me tv me serial change karke news dekhata tha.."

ending 10-15 mins of webseries's last part, srsly gives you a goosebumps..
so it's my secrets to always be prodective..

Hope it work for you... AND BYE - BYE...
